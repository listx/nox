\section{Introduction}

\ct{nox} is a program that comments or uncomments text from STDIN and prints the result to STDOUT.

\subsection{How to Read This Manual}

The general format is to show the raw source code first, followed by commentary on what the just-shown block of code does.
The idea is to try to read the source code first, and then have it explained in detail later.
Whenever the commentary says ``this block of code'' or ``here'', it is referring to the block of code directly above it.
